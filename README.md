# Meal Swipe Use Calculator

Script that calculates daily meal swipes needed to exhaust all meal swipes by the end of the semester.

To-do:

- debugging incorrect math? test with start may 1, end may 2
- Visual with multiple options (i.e. 3 vs. 4 per day?), chrome extension? website?
- With and without break days - though it'll be hard to determine whether or not to include break (?) without asking user since break days vary
- Meal money
